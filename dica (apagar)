If you just want the background of the element to extend across the whole page this can also be achieved with negative margins.

In a nutshell (correction from comment):

.bleed {
padding-left: 3000px;
margin-left: -3000px;
padding-right: 3000px;
margin-right: -3000px;
}
That gives you horizontal scroll bars which you remove with:

body {overflow-x: hidden; }
There is a guide at http://www.sitepoint.com/css-extend-full-width-bars/. It might be more semantic to do this with psuedo elements: http://css-tricks.com/full-browser-width-bars/
